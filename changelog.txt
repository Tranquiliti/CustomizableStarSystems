Version 3.0.1

* Added "tags" option to apply tags to any entity
* Generated player markets no longer have people automatically added to them
  - Done for parity with vanilla colonization mechanics
* System objectives (e.g., Comm Relays, Nav Buoys, Sensor Arrays) now point down to their focus entity
* Updated some error messages to include the cause in the stack trace
* The "SpawnCustomStarSystems" command and LunaSnippet now print the stack trace to starsector.log if an error occurs



Version 3.0.0 (Update for Starsector 0.98a)

* Added "systemAge" option to determine the age of the custom star system
* Added "wreck" entity, which creates a derelict ship
* Added "orbitClockwise" option for "ring" and "asteroid_belt" entities
* Fixed "emptyLocation" not supporting orbits if it was not used as the system center
* Removed nearly all instances of automatic system tagging
  - This includes the "isCoreWorldSystem" option, which is removed in favor of using the "systemTags" option
  - "systemTags" now defaults to only applying the "theme_misc" tag if it is omitted or empty
* People are now automatically added to a custom star system's markets if spawned mid-game
* Fixed bug with "setLocation" option regarding the constellation list having duplicate constellations
* Moved Console Commands commands to src folder



Version 2.1.3

* Added "debris_field" entity, which creates a debris field
* Optimized custom star system generation code
* Changed default "size" for "magnetic_field" entities to 400 (from 300)
* Adjusted the magnetic field for the default custom star system



Version 2.1.2

* "type" option for "star" and "planet" entities can now accept a list of star/planet types
  - A random star/planet type from the list will be selected when generating the entity
  - Default custom star system now uses this "type" option for both its star and the Barren planet
  - Removed "random_star_giant" as a type since it is no longer needed
* Default custom star system no longer contains a research station
* "Generate custom star systems" LunaSnippet now creates a debug button if customStarSystems.json is malformed
  - The exact JSON error will be shown when executing the LunaSnippet again with the button selected
* Added missing particle effects for "coronal_tap" entities created outside the "addCoronalHypershunt" option
* Minor code refactors



Version 2.1.1

* Added "numAsteroids" option for "asteroid_field" and "asteroid_belt" entities
* Added "hyperspaceCenter" setting to settings.json
  - Used to determine the closest constellations for the normal "setLocation" option
* Added "systemSpacing" setting to settings.json
  - Adds to the minimum distance a custom star system generates away from other star systems when using the normal "setLocation" option
  - Increased default spacing to 150 units (from 100)
* Added "marketMemoryKeys" option for planets and stations
  - Similar to "memoryKeys", but for the market of any planet or station (including uninhabited planets and abandoned stations)
* Added String support for "memoryKeys" and "marketMemoryKeys"
* "station" entities can now use the "condition" option regardless of "marketSize"
  - I.e. abandoned stations can now have custom conditions
* Some code refactors



Version 2.1.0

* Added "teleportUponGeneration" option for custom star systems
  - Generating a custom star system with this option enabled will also teleport the player to the newly-created star system
* Added "systemTags" option for custom star systems
  - Option allows additional tags - used to influence how the game treats a given system - to be applied to custom star systems
* Added "memoryKeys" option for all entity types in the "entities" list
  - Meant for advanced users, this allows custom memory keys to be added to an entity's memory
  - Only supports Boolean values for now
* Reduced the orbit radius for the Domain-era Cyrosleeper added through the "addDomainCryosleeper" option
  - Now 1000 units away from the orbit of the furthest jump-point/planet/star, from 4000 units
* Major code refactors
