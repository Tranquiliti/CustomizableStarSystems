Version 2.1.0

* Added "teleportUponGeneration" option for custom star systems
  - Generating a custom star system with this option enabled will also teleport the player to the newly-created star system
* Added "systemTags" option for custom star systems
  - Option allows additional tags - used to influence how the game treats a given system - to be applied to custom star systems
* Added "memoryKeys" option for all entity types in the "entities" list
  - Meant for advanced users, this allows custom memory keys to be added to an entity's memory
  - Only supports Boolean values for now
* Reduced the orbit radius for the Domain-era Cyrosleeper added through the "addDomainCryosleeper" option
  - Now 1000 units away from the orbit of the furthest jump-point/planet/star, from 4000 units
* Major code refactors



Version 2.0.0 (Update for Starsector 0.97)

* Updated to Starsector 0.97



Version 1.0.4

* Fixed the LunaLib soft dependency
  - This means this mod no longer requires either LunaLib or Java 8 to run
* Added "orbitClockwise" option for most entities
  - If set to false, the entity will orbit counter-clockwise instead
* Added more info for error messages
* "isCoreWorldSystem" option now forcibly applies the THEME_CORE tags, instead of relying on those tags being automatically applied by the game
* All custom colonies now always have the "population" (Population & Infrastructure) industry, even if it's not explicitly specified in an "industries" list
  - This avoids situations where removing or not having this industry causes colonies to not work properly
* Minor code refactors



Version 1.0.3

* Fixed a bug where custom star systems with comm relays or similar entities were erroneously marked as though they contained a Coronal Hypershunt
  - This also fixes "isCoreWorldSystem" tags being overridden due to this same bug
* Fixed logging for generating custom star systems during new game creation
* "SpawnCustomStarSystems" command and the related LunaSnippet now print the exception messages for generation and syntax errors, respectively
* Minor code refactors



Version 1.0.2

* "marketSize" option now supports numbers greater than 10 if bigger population conditions exists due to other mods
  - If no such conditions exist (or their IDs do not match the "population_##" string), "marketSize" will continue to cap population size at 10, as before.
* Added "systemLightColor" option for custom star systems
* Added "orbitRadius" support for "accretion_disk" entities
  - Also scaled the default, randomly-generated orbit radius to fix it being smaller than typical proc-gen accretion disks
* Custom star systems with a center black hole no longer auto-generate an accretion disk entity
* Added "orbitDays" support for "ring" and "asteroid_belt" entities
* Fixed an outdated error message
* "ListCustomStarSystems" and "SpawnCustomStarSystems" commands now print the exception message when syntax errors in customStarSystems.json are found



Version 1.0.1

* Changed "setLocation" Core World centroid point to the actual centroid point of all vanilla Core systems.
  - Affects custom star systems with a "setLocation" by changing which constellations are considered closest to Core.
* Added a check to ensure that the "entities" list has at least 1 entry in it.
* Version Checker now points to the right forum thread



Version 1.0.0

* Split off from Adversary mod
  - Now considered a utility mod that can be safely removed from existing saves (although already-generated systems will still remain)
  - Changes from the previous, un-split version are mentioned below
* Revamped the customStarSystem.json format
  - Each custom star system must now have a unique ID.
  - Merged "starsInSystemCenter","orbitingBodies", and "systemFeatures" into a combined "entities" list!
  - Each entry in the "entities" list must have an "entity" option, which determines what entity to make
  - Added "empty_location" entity, which, when placed 1st in "entities" list, also provides similar functionality to the previous "starsInSystemCenter"
  - Removed "setLocationOverride" option; "setLocation" now also supports this functionality
  - Removed "fringeJumpPoint" option; system radius is now determined by the furthest star/planet/jump-point in the system.
  - Star systems with no "jump_point" entities now auto-generate a Fringe Jump-point.
  - Removed "entitiesAtStablePoints" option; "focus" option now also supports this functionality
  - Too many other changes to other entries and options to list all of them here; see the updated referenceStarSystem.json for help with the new format
* Updated referenceStarSystem.json and presetStarSystems.json with the updated format
* Added "SpawnCustomStarSystems" and "ListCustomStarSystems" commands
  - Requires the Console Commands mod to run these commands
  - Intended to allow for spawning custom star systems in an ongoing save; backing up your save beforehand is recommended
  - Also ideal for testing custom star systems, as instant game crashes are less likely when ran in an ongoing save
* Added a LunaSnippet for spawning in custom star systems
  - Requires the LunaLib library mod to use
  - Basically a UI version of the above CC commands
* Updated source code and package names
