Version 1.0.0

* Split off from Adversary mod
  - Now considered a utility mod that can be safely removed from existing saves (although already-generated systems will remain)
* Changed customStarSystem.json format
  - Each custom star system must now have a unique ID.
* Added "SpawnCustomStarSystems" and "ListCustomStarSystems" commands
  - Requires the Console Commands mod to run these commands
  - Intended to allow for spawning custom star systems in an existing game; backing up your save beforehand is recommended
