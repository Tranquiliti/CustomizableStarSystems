Version 1.0.0

* Split off from Adversary mod
  - Now considered a utility mod that can be safely removed from existing saves (although already-generated systems will still remain)
  - Changes from the previous, un-split version are mentioned below
* Revamped the customStarSystem.json format
  - Each custom star system must now have a unique ID.
  - Merged "starsInSystemCenter","orbitingBodies", and "systemFeatures" into a combined "entities" list!
  - Each entry in the "entities" list must have an "entity" sub-option, which determines what entity to make
  - Added "empty_location" entity, which, when placed 1st in "entities" list, also provides similar functionality to the previous "starsInSystemCenter"
  - Removed "setLocationOverride" option; "setLocation" now also supports this functionality
  - Removed "fringeJumpPoint" option; system radius is now determined by the furthest star/planet/jump-point in the system.
  - Star systems with no "jump_point" entities now auto-generate a Fringe Jump-point.
  - Removed "entitiesAtStablePoints" sub-option; "focus" sub-option now also supports this functionality
  - Too many other changes to other entries/options/sub-options to list them here.
* Updated referenceStarSystem.json and presetStarSystems.json with the updated format
* Added "SpawnCustomStarSystems" and "ListCustomStarSystems" commands
  - Requires the Console Commands mod to run these commands
  - Intended to allow for spawning custom star systems in an ongoing save; backing up your save beforehand is recommended
  - Also ideal for testing custom star systems, as instant crashes are less likely when ran in an ongoing save
* Added a LunaSnippet for spawning in custom star systems
  - Requires the LunaLib library mod to use
  - Basically a UI version of the above CC commands
* Updated source code and package names
