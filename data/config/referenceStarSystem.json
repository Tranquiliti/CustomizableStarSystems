# This is simply a reference guide for making and editing custom star systems in customStarSystems.json.
# It should not affect the game in any way.

# Most type IDs are found in the .csv files located in the Starsector/starsector-core/data/campaign folder

# The units for "orbitRadius", "size", and other similar entries are in pixels (e.g. "size":100 means something is 100 pixels wide)
# For reference, the Barad gas giant in the Corvus system has a size of 300 pixels

# It is recommended to have installed either Console Commands or LunaLib to quickly test your custom star systems.
# If starting a new game, any mistakes in customStarSystems.json will likely crash your game either immediately or, worse, upon visiting the affected star system or planet.
# Game crashes are less likely if spawning custom star systems in an existing save (via either Console Commands or LunaLib's LunaSnippets).

# Open presetStarSystems.json for some preset custom star systems to copy or edit.
